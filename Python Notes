#Lesson 10 - Development Lifecycle & Agile Techniques
# SDLC: Software Development Lifecycle
1: Plan
2: Requirements
3: Design
4: Implement
5: Test & Integrate
6: Deploy
7: Maintain

Testing: different for environments
Code quality testing
Unit testing: test particular lines of code
Security testing
User testing: production environment (customers visit website)

Testing: regular: automate
Output of testing phase can be functional software
Make sure it's ready for deployment to production environment

Development environment: available to developers
Production

Development: don't make accidental changes, so that you can test things without user seeing
Work safely without users viewing work in progress

Methodologies:
Agile, Lean, Waterfall, Iterative, Spiral, DevOps

Waterfall:
Predefined requirements, unlikely to change
No ambiguous requirements
Project is short, move through phases quickly

Agile:
Same phases, but go back and forth in cycles
Complete one cycle, runs through
Get customer feedback much faster
Withouth knowing requirements, can't predict resources and time necessary
good for changing require,emts
lower costs - can change at each cycle
